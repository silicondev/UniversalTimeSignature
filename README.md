# Universal Time Signature
~by Josh Sims (silicondev)~
---
This is an attempt to create a digital and scientific standard that expands upon the pre-existing Unix Timestamp. Once fully developed, UTS will be an easily readable Base-62 string, comprising of the total amount of ticks (100 nanoseconds) since the beginning of time.
---
The Base-62 format is as such:
`0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
---
Final product of this project will be a frontend app which will convert the current date and time into UTS, and also allowing the conversion of any other given date and time, alongside a library which can be used in your application to get a UTS string from a given DateTime object.
---
If you wish to fork the project or use the library in your own, please credit myself and include a link to the repository.
